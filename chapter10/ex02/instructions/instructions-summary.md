## Instructions

In this lab, you create a graphical user interface in a partially completed Java program. The program should create two `JButton` components. Display the text **Yes** on one of the `JButton` components, and display the text **No** on the other `JButton`. You should also create three JLabels. Display the text Do you like GUI programming? **Vote Yes or No.** on one of the `JLabel` components. Display the text **Click here** to vote "Yes" on another `JLabel`, and display the text **Click here** to vote "No" on the third `JLabel`. Also, add event handlers that cause the background color of the `JPanel` to change to yellow if a user votes yes and to red if a user votes no. Use the `GuiDemo` class discussed in this section as a guide.
