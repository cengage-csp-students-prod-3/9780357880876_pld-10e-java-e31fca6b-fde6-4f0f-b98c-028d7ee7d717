## Instructions

In this lab, you use the flowchart and pseudocode found in the figures below to add code to a partially created Java program. When completed, college admissions officers should be able to use the Java program to determine whether to accept or reject a student, based on his or her test score and class rank.

```
start
   input testScore, classRank
   if testScore >= 90 then
      if classRank >= 25 then
         output "Accept"
      else
         output "Reject"
      endif
   else
      if testScore >= 80 then
         if classRank >= 50 then
            output "Accept"
         else
            output "Reject"
         endif
      else
         if testScore >= 70 then
            if classRank >= 75 then
               output "Accept"
            else
               output "Reject"
            endif
         else
            output "Reject"
         endif
      endif
   endif
stop
```
